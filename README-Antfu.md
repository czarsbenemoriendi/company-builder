<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I decided to use ready-made solutions such as Storefront-ui. During the configuration process, I encountered a bug related to packages, which I reported on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/vuestorefront/storefront-ui/issues/2793">here</a>.

I plan to return to the project, work on it, and further develop it. Initially, I wanted to create an e-commerce application, but due to a busy schedule and the number of features I wanted to implement, I did not undertake this task. Thanks to the assignment I received, I finally decided to give it a try.

Since this is not yet a final project, it is difficult for me to say that I am proud of it. However, I am proud of the fact that I took on this task.

There are a few things that I definitely want to work on, such as creating a new layout and implementing middleware.




### Built With

I used an already prepared template created by Antfu, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-nuxt3">here</a>.
